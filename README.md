Solutions in python to Andrew Ng's machine learning coursera course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

These python solutions are designed to mimic but not replicate the original exercises.
In particular, naming conventions will stick close to the original (even if these names are not great), and the calculation functions
should line up closely, but some plotting functions will be omitted.
